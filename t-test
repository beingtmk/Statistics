A t-test is a statistic that checks if two means are reliably different from each other.

In other words, t-test tells us how likely is the difference between the means reliable (wheather it was just chance or had some cause)

t = variance betn groups / variance within groups

Each t-value has corresponding p-value

p-value: probability that the pattern produced by data can be produced randomly

Bigger samples are helpful but with diminishing returns. (20-30+ datapoints is enough)

df (degree of freedom): (sample size - 1)

Limitations:
1. can be generalized to same types of samples (adult data point to children)
2. needs to be normal
3. need around same number of samples in each group
4. datapoints should be independent
5. should not be classification like (1st, 2nd adn 3rd) not same difference.

Overcoming Limitations:
1. Monte Carlo Simulation to see if its safe to use t-test.
2. Non-parametric tests, Mann-Whitney U for non-normal, ordered datasets, less powerful

1. Independent Samples, between, unpaired
2. Paired Samples, within-subjects, repeated-measures, dependent-samples (Beware of ordering effect) 
3. One Sample

Descriptive Statistics: These are stats, such as a mean, that describe your data, but can't be generalized beyond that.

Inferential Statistics: These are stats, such as t-test, that allow us to make inferences about the population beyond our data.
